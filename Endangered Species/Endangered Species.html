				<p>	The Tasmanian devil got his name from European settlers. By the alarming,
				haunting screeches, the early European settlers gave it it's name of the Tasmanian
				devil. Tasmanian devils can be found almost anywhere in Tasmania from the coast 
				even to the mountains. </p>

			<h2> Devil threats and Conservation </h2>
<!--This is a paragrapgh talking about why it is an endangered species-->
				<p>Since the Tasmanian Devil would kill and eat livestock, the settlers would kill 
				them. After many years of this, eventually the Tasmanian devil became very rare and now 
				considered endangered. In 1914, there was a protective law passed which has helped. But 
				many people believe that the Tasmanian devil might be extinct. Many people on the local, 
				national, and international level are all trying their best to prevent this possible reality. </p>
