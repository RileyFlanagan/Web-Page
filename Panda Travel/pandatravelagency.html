				<p>The Colosseum is one of Rome's most recognizable classic buildings. It 
				was the first permanent amphitheatre to be raised in Rome and also with the 
				the most impressive arena the world has ever seen. </p>
			<h2>Why come?</h2>
				<p>The Colosseum is definitely one of the most historical and interesting
				buildings throughout all of Rome. The arena is huge and is such an amazing 
				sight to see. Everyone knows it's a "must see" for all first time visitors 
				in Rome. Being able to actually see where the fights took place and the huge 
				seating area is breathtaking.

			<h2>Reviews</h2>
				<p>"Rome is a stunning city! The Colosseum is a masterpiece. I admire how well it 
				has been kept up."
			<br />
				"This is the one place I would visit every time I come to Rome. The architecture 
				and history of the place is amazing. However one thing I highly recommend is to 
				buy one of those tickets for a "skip line" pass it was very helpful to make the whole 
				experience more enjoyable."
			<br />
				"It was the ultimate MUST-SEE sight. Truly stunning up close with many such incredible tours." </p>
